## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue in a stable version of habitica-boss, DO NOT create a public issue on Github for it. This could allow attackers to take advantage of users before an update can be rolled out.

To report a vulnerability, please send @loverofbooks a private message on Habitica.

Alternatively, [contact him via his website](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/contact/).
